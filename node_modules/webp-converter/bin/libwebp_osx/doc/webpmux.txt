DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the webpmux command.

       webpmux can be used to create/extract from animated WebP files, as well
       as to add/extract/strip XMP/EXIF metadata and ICC profile.  If a single
       file  name  (not  starting  with  the character '-') is supplied as the
       argument, the command line arguments are actually tokenized  from  this
       file.   This  allows  for easy scripting or using large number of argu-
       ments.

OPTIONS
   GET_OPTIONS (-get):
       icc    Get ICC profile.

       exif   Get EXIF metadata.

       xmp    Get XMP metadata.

       frame n
              Get nth frame from an animated image. (n = 0 has a special mean-
              ing: last frame).


   SET_OPTIONS (-set)
       icc file.icc
              Set ICC profile.

       Where: 'file.icc' contains the ICC profile to be set.

       exif file.exif
              Set EXIF metadata.

       Where: 'file.exif' contains the EXIF metadata to be set.

       xmp file.xmp
              Set XMP metadata.

       Where: 'file.xmp' contains the XMP metadata to be set.


   STRIP_OPTIONS (-strip)
       icc    Strip ICC profile.

       exif   Strip EXIF metadata.

       xmp    Strip XMP metadata.


   DURATION_OPTIONS (-duration)
       Amend  the  duration  of  a specific interval of frames. This option is
       only effective on animated WebP and has no  effect  on  a  single-frame
       file.

       duration[,start[,end]]
              Where:
              duration  is  the  duration  for  the  interval  in milliseconds
              (mandatory).  Must be non-negative.
              start is the starting frame index of the interval (optional).
              end is the  ending  frame  index  (inclusive)  of  the  interval
              (optional).

       The three typical usages of this option are:
              -duration d
                   set the duration to 'd' for the whole animation.
              -duration d,f
                   set the duration of frame 'f' to 'd'.
              -duration d,start,end
                   set the duration to 'd' for the whole [start,end] interval.


              Note that the frames outside of the [start, end]  interval  will
              remain untouched.
              The 'end' value '0' has the special meaning 'last frame  of  the
              animation'.

       Reminder:
              frame indexing starts at '1'.


   FRAME_OPTIONS (-frame)
       Create  an animated WebP file from multiple (non-animated) WebP images.

       file_i +di[+xi+yi[+mi[bi]]]
              Where: 'file_i' is the i'th frame (WebP format), 'xi','yi' spec-
              ify  the image offset for this frame, 'di' is the pause duration
              before next frame, 'mi' is the dispose method for this frame  (0
              for  NONE  or  1 for BACKGROUND) and 'bi' is the blending method
              for this frame (+b for BLEND or -b for NO_BLEND).  Argument 'bi'
              can  be  omitted and will default to +b (BLEND).  Also, 'mi' can
              be omitted if 'bi' is omitted and  will  default  to  0  (NONE).
              Finally,  if 'mi' and 'bi' are omitted then 'xi' and 'yi' can be
              omitted and will default to +0+0.

       -loop n
              Loop the frames n number of times. 0 indicates the frames should
              loop  forever.   Valid  range  is  0 to 65535 [Default: 0 (infi-
              nite)].

       -bgcolor A,R,G,B
              Background color of the canvas.
              where: 'A', 'R', 'G' and 'B' are integers in the range 0 to  255
              specifying  the  Alpha,  Red,  Green  and  Blue component values
              respectively [Default: 255,255,255,255].


   INPUT
       Input file in WebP format.


   OUTPUT (-o)
       Output file in WebP format.


   Note:
       The nature of EXIF, XMP and ICC data is not checked and is  assumed  to
       be valid.

       Using -get/-set/-strip with input file name starting with '-':
       webpmux -set icc image_profile.icc -o icc_container.webp -- ---in.webp
       webpmux -get icc -o image_profile.icc -- ---icc_container.webp
       webpmux -strip icc -o without_icc.webp -- ---icc_container.webp
